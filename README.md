# The Face of a Character called Gmork

This repository contains the code and resources related to the paper "The Face of a Character called Gmork".

## Overview

We have generated portraits of fictional characters based on their names using cross-model generative AI models (Stable Diffusion and VQGAN+CLIP), which both rely on the CLIP encoder. Our study aims to understand to what extent image generation captures names' gender and age connotations given different linguistic distributions.


## Image Generation
The image generation process in this project heavily relies on the work of Federico Bianchi (link to the repository [social-diffusers](https://github.com/vinid/social-diffusers)) and the notebook of Katherine Crowson for VQGAN+CLIP ([notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justinjohn0306/VQGAN-CLIP/blob/main/VQGAN%2BCLIP(Updated).ipynb))

The notebook to generate images is available here: [![Open In Colab][colab-badge]][colab-notebook]

Here are some examples of the images generated:
